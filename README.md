ðŸ”¥ Azure Sentinel with Live Cyberattacks â€“ SIEM HomeLab
GitHub Repository: SIEM-HomeLab

ðŸš€ Project Overview
Built a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) HomeLab using Azure Sentinel to monitor, analyze, and respond to live cyberattacks. This setup involved integrating multiple data sources, creating custom detection rules, and simulating attack scenarios.

ðŸ›  Key Skills Gained:
âœ… SIEM Implementation â€“ Set up Azure Sentinel for real-time security monitoring.
âœ… Log Analysis & Threat Detection â€“ Collected and analyzed logs from various sources (Windows, Linux, Firewalls).
âœ… Incident Response â€“ Developed and tested automated response playbooks.
âœ… Live Cyberattack Simulation â€“ Simulated Brute Force, SQL Injection, and Phishing Attacks to evaluate system defenses.
âœ… Threat Intelligence Integration â€“ Used MITRE ATT&CK Framework for enhanced security insights.

PS: All my own files are in another laptop and i had too download other files and upload :).
